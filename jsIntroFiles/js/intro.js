//JS statements are ACTIONS we tell Javascript to perform
//change this content, update or add this, change the look of that

//using the console for testing
console.log("Hello World! This is me testing that I linked the javascript correctly.");


//STRINGS are pieces of text and must alway go WITHIN quotes



//conversely, NUMBERS do not go within quotes
console.log(4 + 5);


//Numbers allows you to do math stuff like seeing if something is less than something else




//simple variables
//variables are temporary holders of data - it can change depending on conditions that we set in the code
let animal;



//we give variables a VALUE when we want them to hold something
animal = "unicorn";
animal = "platypus";



//variables also don't have quotes when we want to use them - although their values can
console.log(animal);



//we can overwrite or set an NEW VALUE to a pre-existing variable 
//when we do so, we don't use the keyword var again
animal = "minotaur";
console.log(animal);



//as you can see what is printed out to the console the second time is different because we changed the value of the variable

//CONCATENATION - This is the fancy coding word for 'adding things together'. Not in a math sense but adding bit of text or values together
//for example, what is we want to pring to the console "My favourite animal is [and whatever is in the animal variable"
console.log("My favourite animal is " + animal);



//We aren't bound to just putting stuff in the console!!! This is a great way to test and debug and find errors

//Changing the DOM - Document Object Model
//We can change the content on ANY element on a page with it's ID
//we use the JavaScript METHOD getElementById() to select something
//We use the PROPERTY .innerHTML to state that we want to change the HTML that is inside of it
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML = "<h3>Wow!</h3> <p>This is AMAZING!!! I'm actually so tired right now...<p>";
//+= means to add it to what is already there, so it won't overwrite it
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML += "<p> I am such a genius!</p>";
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML += "<img class='img-fluid' src='images/code.jpg'>";

//We can change more than just the content! We can change the looks
//This time we will add the id 'column2' to the next column over and then change the css of it!
//we will select it by the id
//Then use the .style to say we want to change the css of it and then state which property we want to change
document.getElementById('column2').style.color = "#FFFFFFFF";
document.getElementById('column2').style.fontSize = "32pt";
document.getElementById('column2').style.backgroundColor = "#4b684e";


//LOGIC!
//THE MOST powerful aspect about any kind of coding is that we can use logic to create a custom interaction with the user
//This means we can give the browser instructions on what to do depending on something else
//For example, in a game, perhaps you can pick up a better weapon, which in turn causes more damage
//So the amount of damage points is BASED on which weapon is being used 
animal = "whale"
if (animal == "minotaur") {
    console.log("You battle with the minotaur");
} else {
    console.log("You go for a picnic");
}


//we will create a variable that holds the 'weapon' that the user has	
let weapon = "Fists";

//if the weapon equals fists, then change the inner html of column 3 to say "<p>you are using fists</p>" -- and else if the weapon equals Squids then give a different message, otherwise (else) then give them a different message -- if(condition){is the statement if that is true}else if(){}else{}
if (weapon == "Fists") {
    document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>You are using fists</p>";
} else if (weapon == "Squids") {
    document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>You are using SQUID POWER</p>"
} else {
    document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>You have no weapon :(</p>"
}


let damage = 0;
if (weapon == "Fists") {
    damage = 5;
} else if (weapon == "Squids") {
    damage = 10;
} else {
    damage = 0;
}
console.log(damage);


//change the content in the third column
document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += weapon + " have damage of: " + damage;

//Then we will print out content to the page depending on which weapon they have
//This is LOGIC
//we will use an 'IF STATEMENT' to change the message they receive based on the variable holding the weapon




//Let's take it a step further and say the opponent has a health of 100 points
let health = 100;

//Send a message to column3 with what the opponent's health is
document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>Opponent Health: " + health + "</p>";

//then we will define damage points for each type of weaapon




//use the console to test is the damage variable is working correctly



//Let's change column3 and send the user a message
//CONCATENTATE the 'weapon' name and the STRING ' have this much damage: ' and then the 'damage' amount



//Now let's say the user has hit the opponent with their weapon
//We need to MINUS the 'damage' from the opponents 'health'
health = health - damage;


//then send the message with the new 'health' value
document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>Opponent Health: " + health + " </p>";


//Hit them AGAIN and send the new health message

health = health - damage;


//then send the message with the new 'health' value

document.getElementById("column3").innerHTML += "<p>Opponent Health: " + health + " </p>";
