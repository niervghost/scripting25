                <img src="Photos/Shadow.jpg" alt="A full body photo of Shadow the Hedgehog">
                <p>The Sonic the Hedgehog series features a character named Shadow the Hedgehog. A frequent and fierce
                    foe
                    of <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog" target="_blank">Sonic the
                        Hedgehog,</a>
                    whom he
                    resembles and shares many abilities with. “Ultimate Lifeform” Shadow was developed by <a
                        href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Gerald_Robotnik" target="_blank">Professor Gerald
                        Robotnik</a>
                    on
                    board the Space Colony ARK more than fifty years ago. He is the outcome of Project Shadow, a
                    government
                    experiment that could only be finished by giving Shadow the extraterrestrial <a
                        href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Doom" target="_blank"> Black Doom's</a> DNA.</p>



                <p>Following his birth, Shadow became friends with <a
                        href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Robotnik" target="_blank">Maria Robotnik,</a> Gerald's
                    granddaughter. But the Guardian Units of Nations <a
                        href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_Units_of_Nations" target="_blank">(G.U.N.)</a>
                    thought
                    the
                    initiative was dangerous and attacked the <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Colony_ARK"
                        target="_blank">ARK,</a> killing Maria and capturing Shadow and Gerald. Gerald, driven insane,
                    changed
                    Shadow's memories in order to get retribution in the future. Before being released by <a
                        href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Eggman" target="_blank">Dr. Eggman,</a> Gerald's
                    grandson,
                    Shadow had been in stasis for decades. Driven by a desire for revenge, Shadow battled Sonic and his
                    companions until his genuine recollections of Maria reappeared, motivating him to defend the planet
                    against
                    Gerald's apocalyptic scheme. But in the process of falling to Earth, Shadow lost his memory. Only
                    until
                    he
                    had to deal with the Black Arms invasion of Earth would Shadow realize the truth of his existence.
                    Since
                    then, he had defended the Earth and its people as a dark hero, fighting for Maria's desire for
                    peace.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <img src="Photos/sb.jpg" alt="A magazine cover of Shadow the Hedgehog">
                <p>In terms of demeanor, Shadow is, to put it simply, Sonic's complete opposite—a gloomy recluse. He
                    seldom
                    displays his sensitive side, preferring to operate with a cold, businesslike indifference. Being a
                    natural
                    introvert, he rarely spends a lot of time with people and often keeps his distance from almost
                    everyone.
                    He
                    speaks little and is typically direct, yet in battle he always knows precisely what to say. But
                    Shadow
                    never
                    bluffs; he always intends to follow through on his threats.</p>



                <p>Because of Shadow's hostility and brutality, opponents never regard him lightly, despite Shadow
                    occasionally
                    being the most vicious and merciless character in the series. In addition to his violent and black
                    personality, Shadow can also be arrogant and unyielding. He typically handles others with extreme
                    callousness, expressing his opinions regardless of how heartless they may be and without caring
                    about
                    the
                    reaction. Shadow's wit is also seen during the Space Colony ARK incident, when he responded that
                    Sonic
                    was
                    not worthy of becoming his fake after being labeled a faker.</p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>Shadow has superhuman speed, just like many of his colleagues. Shadow, who is said to have “ultimate
                    speed,”
                    can equal Sonic's speeds, which may surpass light speed. Shadow's speed has been attributed to his
                    Air
                    Shoes, yet he can easily match Sonic's world-class speed because of his strong physique. He can
                    outrun
                    bullets, scale ceilings and vertical surfaces, and attack more quickly than the human eye can follow
                    because
                    of his incredible speed. Even so, Shadow can increase his speed even further. By enclosing himself
                    in an
                    orange energy field, he can briefly transcend the sound barrier both on the ground and in midair,
                    which
                    enables him to fly great distances through midair and smash through enemies and obstacles like a
                    living
                    projectile.</p>

                <img src="Photos/shadow G.jpg" alt="The Japanese game poster for Shadow the Hedgehog">

                <p>In order to enhance himself and access various chaotic abilities, Shadow may naturally draw on the
                    arcane
                    energies of adjacent <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Emerald" target="_blank">Chaos
                        Emeralds,</a> physically or virtually. Shadow claims that only he is capable of harnessing the
                    full
                    power of the Chaos Emeralds. He uses the Chaos Emeralds to create Chaos Control, his signature
                    ability
                    in
                    the realm of chaotic powers, which allows him to manipulate time and space for a variety of
                    purposes.
                    Shadow's ability to manipulate time and space allows him to create regions of warped space, slow
                    down or
                    freeze time completely, and instantly warp himself and people nearby across space at a
                    range farther than any island-destroying explosion or across worlds.</p>
