                                Aster Harris is a first-year student specializing in photography/videography and music
                                creation
                                in
                                the Multimedia Program at Lethbridge Polytechnic. Although they have so many interests
                                that
                                it
                                is
                                difficult for them to keep up with them all, they enjoy taking pictures of live music
                                events
                                and
                                concerts in their spare time. They like doing this because it combines two of their
                                favourite things, allows them to learn more about the technical aspects of music
                                production,
                                exposes
                                them to a variety of musical genres, and helps them improve their shooting and Adobe
                                Photoshop
                                editing skills. Computer science, or more generally anything pertaining to the inner
                                workings of
                                a
                                computer, is another pastime of theirs. Their passion for video games translated
                                into computer parts, and their finances have never been more precarious. They have been
                                able
                                to
                                love
                                this hobby despite the mathematical aspects of it all since they are always eager to
                                learn
                                more
                                about coding and video game development.

                            Aster is immensely pleased with their abilities to bounce back from adversity, endure
                            through
                            early
                            childhood education, and complete high school. The majority of their achievements are
                            personal
                            triumphs; however, they don't have any noteworthy achievements. Aster received a prize in
                            junior
                            high for having “most growth” in the school band. Since then, they have written their own
                            classical
                            sheet music to perform at contests and assisted in composing original scores for other
                            junior
                            high
                            school bands. As the world changes, they have made it their personal mission to support the
                            ecosystem and strike a balance between technology and environment. They have also done a
                            great
                            deal
                            of volunteer conservation work around North America. Therefore, they have used multimedia
                            work
                            to
                            reach and interact with the younger generations on such a topic. Since then, they've also
                            been
                            discovering more environmentally friendly technology and ways to use it to maintain the
                            health
                            of
                            the earth.

                            Outside of work, Aster is the youngest of siblings with only an older brother and their
                            parents.
                            They have relatives from British Columbia to Hungary, although they were born and raised in
                            Lethbridge. Apart from their primary passions, Aster is an avid reader who will read
                            anything.
                            Additionally, they will probably be crocheting or building Lego if you don't find them
                            reading,
                            which also puts a significant strain on their finances. On the days that they do take a
                            break
                            from
                            their continual busyness and make time to be more present; they either take their two dogs
                            for a
                            walk or curl up with one of their three cats and binge-watch television. Although Aster has
                            been
                            influenced by numerous things throughout their life, the mysterious band <a href="https://www.sleep-token.com" target="_blank">Sleep Token</a>
                            has been a constant. Not only does their music resonate deeply with them and has helped them
                            get
                            through many difficult times, but it is also radically different from much of the music
                            industry. In
                            addition to providing Aster with a great deal of creative inspiration in all forms, they
                            have
                            also
                            assisted them in reestablishing a sense of belonging and self-love, something they have
                            really battled against. Since then, they are motivated to carry on that legacy and save and
                            uplift
                            others in the same manner that Sleep Token has done for them.
